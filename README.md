This **optimized Base64 to image converter** allows you to seamlessly convert Base64-encoded image strings into image URLs.

With this tool, you can store the converted image data directly in your local state, eliminating the need to save images to specific directories or paths. This approach is both **efficient** and **straightforward, reducing file management overhead**.

#### Do I need to store the converted ImageURL into some directory ?

**No.** You can just store converted ImageURL locally in some varaible like const or var or react useState and use it when needed.

#### Will using this package increase optimization ?

**Yes.** Since the converted image is not stored in some directory, this helps in optimization of both storage and run time efficiency.
